	<h1 style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">SHARKS NEED OUR <span class="red">PROTECTION</span></h1>
</font>
<font size="6">

	<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">According to the IUCN, a quarter of the world’s shark species are threatened with extinction due to overfishing – every year, over 100 million sharks are slaughtered. Many are killed by the <span class="blue">cruel practice of finning</span>, where sharks have their fins sliced off while alive and are thrown back into the water where, unable to swim, die slowly.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
	<img src="images/w20pic2.jpg" style="width:100%;">
<div style="background-color:lightgrey">
<blockquote>
	<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">Sharks have been around for over 150 million years. While most of us are familiar with a few shark species, there are over 400 species of sharks. Their presence is critical to the health of fragile marine ecosystems.</p>
	<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">Despite their reputation as ruthless killers, sharks are much more likely to fall victims to humans than the other way around. Illegal fishing as well as markets across the globe for shark fins – <span class="orange">used to make soup</span> – are a significant part of the demand that is fueling the killing.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
	<img src="images/w20pic3.jpg" style="width:100%;">
<div style="background-color:lightgrey">
<blockquote>
	<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">Recent conservation efforts have helped to slow the sharp decline but sharks grow very slowly, taking years to mature and they produce very few young. These characteristics make the shark particularly vulnerable. Shark populations simply cannot replenish at the rate by which they are being slaughtered.</p>
	<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">Meaningful wildlife protection laws and better enforcement will make a difference in ending the trade in shark products, and will give shark populations a chance to rebound to healthy levels.</p>

<h1 style="font-family:Tekton Pro;"><span class="orange">3 TYPES OF SHARKS THAT CAUSES</span> <span class="blue">DOUBLE DAMAGE</span></h1>
</font>
<font size="6">
<h2 style="font-family:Tekton Pro;"><span class="purple">GREAT WHITE SHARK</span></h2>

<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">The largest predatory fish in the world – capable of eating marine mammals that weigh several hundred pounds – is the great white shark. The only two fishes that grow larger than Great Whites are the whale shark and the basking shark, both filter feeders that eat plankton.The great white, on the other hand, is known to be an aggressive predator and has an extremely muscular body, capable of chasing down some of the fastest swimmers in the ocean.  Reaching lengths of up to 20 feet (6 m) and weights of several tons, the great white’s body is perfectly adapted to a life of predation.</p>

<font size="6">
<blockquote>
<h2 style="font-family:Tekton Pro;"><span class="purple">TIGER SHARK</span></h2>

<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">The tiger shark gets its name from the characteristic vertical bars that cover the sides of its body. Though these bars fade slightly as individuals reach adulthood, they are very noticeable in juveniles and at least party visible throughout the lifetime. Reaching lengths of at least 18 feet (5.5 m) and 2000 pounds (nearly a metric tonne), the tiger shark is the fourth largest shark and second largest predatory shark, behind only the great white.</p>
<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">Tiger sharks are aggressive predators, famous for eating just about anything they find or are able to capture. They have been known to eat many different fishes and invertebrates, seabirds, sea turtles, some marine mammals, stingrays and other rays, smaller sharks, sea snakes, and scavenged dead animals, among other things. Several tiger sharks have been known to eat garbage, including metal, plastic, wood, fishing gear, and other trash. Though they are generalist predators, in some areas, tiger sharks likely specialize on certain highly available prey. For example, in Hawaii, tiger sharks are known to regularly attack and eat green turtles and hawaiian monk seals near the nesting beaches for those two species.</p>

<div style="background-color:lightgrey">
<font size="6">
<blockquote>
<h2 style="font-family:Tekton Pro;"><span class="purple">BULL SHARK</span></h2>

<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">The bull shark is a predatory species that lives in coastal seas and is the shark with the best ability to move into freshwaters – particularly large, coastal rivers and lakes. They are <span class="blue">able to move back and forth between saltwater and freshwater with ease</span>. This behavior brings them into more contact with humans than most species of sharks, and they are therefore responsible for fatally biting more people than any other species.</p>
<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">Reaching lengths of 11 feet (3.5 m) and weights up to nearly 700 pounds (315 kg), the bull shark is one of the largest requiem sharks (Family Carcharhinide). They are aggressive predators and eat a variety of prey. They are known to eat several species of bony fishes and also small sharks, some mammals (both terrestrial and marine), seabirds, and occasionally sea turtles. Large, adult bull sharks do not have any natural predators. Bull sharks do not mature until they are 15 or 20 years old. They mate via internal fertilization and give birth to well-developed, live young. Though they give live birth, bull sharks do not connect to their young through a placenta. Instead, during the gestation period, the embryos survive off of yolk sacs attached to each individual.</p>
