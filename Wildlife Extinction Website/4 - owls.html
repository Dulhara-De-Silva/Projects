	<h1 style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">WHY ARE OWLS <span class="red">THREATENED?</span></h1>
</font>
<font size="6">

	<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">The owl population has seen a decline over the past decades caused by hunting, lack of prey and habitat, and viral diseases. Several owl species prey on insects have seen numbers drop after consuming insects sprayed with insecticide and is most evident in the burrowing owl. The burrowing owl has also seen its savannah habitat destroyed by humans who find the habitat ideal for large-scale wheat farming. In South East Asia, the owl population has seen a decline caused by poaching, especially in Malaysia.</p>

	<h1 style="font-family:Tekton Pro;"><span class="purple">CAN WE SAVE THESE BIRDS?</span></h1>
</font>

<font size="6">
	<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">There have been measures put in place by organizations to curb the declining owl population which include banning of owl hunting as well as establishing protective areas on owl habitat areas to prevent the destruction of their habitat. Another measure that has been introduced recently is sensitizing farmers to use owls as pest control instead of the use of pesticides. Owls naturally prey on rodents and other insects which are nuisances to farmers.</p>

	<h1 style="font-family:Tekton Pro;"><span class="orange"><span class="blue">ANATOMY</span> OF OWLS</span></h1>
</font>

<font size="6">
	<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">The birds of the Strigiformes order have very distinct physical characteristics. The most obvious are their huge eyes. Owls have the biggest eyes of all birds and more than most animals irrespective to their body size. These eyes are critical for their prowess in nocturnal hunting behavior and they can see prey in almost total darkness. The big eyes are fused to their sockets giving the birds perfect binocular vision. However, this also means the birds have to turn their heads to have a side view or see their rear and have developed a flexible neck enabling them to turn their heads more than 180 degrees.</p>
	<p style="font-family:Tekton Pro;">Another distinct feature is their almost-round face. The shape is an evolutionary adaptation which enhances their excellent auditory abilities. Various studies have shown that in total darkness owls can identify prey using their hearing and can capture even low-frequency sounds. The owls have large feathers especially on their wings with serrated edges which aid in gliding silently in the dark when hunting.</p>

<caption>Owl Threats</caption>
	<tr>
	<th>Poison</th>
	<td>Poisons used to kills rats, mice, and other rodents remain in the animals’ bodies and can poison owls that may prey on those rodents after they are contaminated.</td>	
	<td rowspan="2"><img src="images/w4pic8.jpg"></td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th>Vehicles</th>
	<td>Many owls fly low over roadways while hunting, or they may catch prey at the side of roads and then be vulnerable to being hit by passing cars.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th>Fences</th>
	<td colspan="2">Fences are a threat to owls that feed in open areas, such as barn owls and short-eared owls. While flying over the fields to hunt, these birds can easily collide with fences and become tangled in the wire or netting, causing injuries, damaged feathers, strangulation, or starvation.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th>Outdoor decorations</th>
	<td colspan="2">Like fences, outdoor decorations are dangerous to birds when they are strung across potential flight paths, such as outdoor lights or fake cobwebs decorating a yard. These decorations can snare birds, which can lead to broken bones and other injuries as well as making them more vulnerable to other predators.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th>Habitat loss</th>
	<td colspan="2">All birds are vulnerable to habitat loss, and logging often destroys the forest habitats preferred by many owls.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th>Nesting site loss</th>
	<td colspan="2">Many owls are cavity-nesting birds that require old, hollow trees for suitable nesting sites. As those trees are removed the birds have no safe place to raise owlets and their breeding success declines dramatically.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th>Poaching</th>
	<td colspan="2">Owls may be poached and brought into illegal captivity. Owl eggs may also be stolen from nests so the chicks can be raised in captivity.</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th>Superstitions</th>
	<td colspan="2">Many cultures have superstitions about owls as harbingers of death or evil, and because of those misconceptions, the birds may be deliberately discriminated against and harmed.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th>Birders</th>
	<td colspan="2">Most owls are nocturnal or crepuscular and roost during the day, and birders can disturb that critical rest time. If attention is drawn to the owl, nearby birds may mob the owl and force it to relocate to a less desirable location.</td>
	</tr>
